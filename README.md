# Cordova RAM Info Plugin

The Cordova RAM Info Plugin is a simple Cordova plugin that allows you to retrieve information about the device's RAM (Random-Access Memory). It provides details such as total RAM, used RAM, free RAM, and RAM usage percentage.

## Installation

To use this plugin in your Cordova project, you can install it using the following command:

```bash
cordova plugin add cordova-ram-info
```

## Usage

Once the plugin is installed, you can use the `CordovaRAMInfo` object to retrieve RAM information in your JavaScript code.

```javascript
CordovaRAMInfo.getRAMInfo(
    function(info) {
        // Handle the RAM information here
        console.log("Total RAM: " + info.totalRAM + " bytes");
        console.log("Used RAM: " + info.usedRAM + " bytes");
        console.log("Free RAM: " + info.freeRAM + " bytes");
        console.log("RAM Usage Percentage: " + info.ramUsagePercent + "%");
    },
    function(error) {
        // Handle any errors here
        console.error("Error: " + error);
    }
);
```

The `getRAMInfo` method returns an object with the following fields:

- `totalRAM`: The total physical RAM available on the device in bytes.
- `usedRAM`: The amount of RAM that is currently in use in bytes.
- `freeRAM`: The amount of free RAM available for use in bytes.
- `ramUsagePercent`: The percentage of RAM usage, calculated as (usedRAM / totalRAM) * 100.

## Platform Support

This plugin is designed to work on both Android and iOS platforms. The native implementations for retrieving RAM information are platform-specific and are provided for both Android (Java) and iOS (Objective-C).
